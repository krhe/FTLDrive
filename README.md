# FTLDrive
Ever wished you where somewhere else instantly. With the Kerbal Science Foundry faster
than light (FTL) drive you can! Just spin it up to create an instant reality dysfunction that might, 
just might transport you instantly to another point in space.

To actually end up where you want to go, instead of experiencing a permanent fatal reality dis-coherence (i.e.
you ship goes puff, aka. explodes) there are a few recommendations to observe:
- Place a FTL beacon where you want to go, otherwise, the FTL drive cannot get a lock on your target destination 
and will refuse to even spin up.
- Never, never, ever spin up the drive in a strong gravity field, keep far away from planets, suns, and other heavy objects.

Other than that the FTL drive holds the promise to revolutionize interplanetary transfers and to take the grind out of 
flying vessels from one point in the Kerbol system to another.
